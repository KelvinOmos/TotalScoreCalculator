# Total Score Calculation for Array of Integers

## Overview

This project calculates a total score based on specific conditions applied to an array of integers. The rules for scoring are simple:

- **1 point** for each even number in the array.
- **3 points** for each odd number in the array.
- **5 points** for every occurrence of the number **8** in the array.

The task is to iterate through the array and compute the total score based on the aforementioned rules.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, calculate the total score based on the following:

1. Add **1 point** for each even number in the array.
2. Add **3 points** for each odd number in the array.
3. Add **5 points** for every time you encounter the number **8** in the array.

### Input:

- An array of integers (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`).

### Output:

- A single integer representing the total score based on the scoring rules.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```json
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
**Output:**
```json
[11]
